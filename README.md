## MaxSum

You are given a binary tree. Implement the method maxSum which returns the maximal sum of a route from root to leaf. For example, given the following tree:

```
        17
       /  \
      3   -10
     /    /  \
    2    16   1
             /
            13
```

The method should return 23, since `{17, -10, 16}` is the route from root to leaf with the maximal sum.

The class `TreeNode` is available for you:

``` java
    class TreeNode {
        private int value;
        private TreeNode left;
        private TreeNode right;
        // ...
    }
```
